### About Shoreline
The Shoreline platform provides real-time monitoring, alerting, and incident automation for cloud operations. Use Shoreline to detect, debug, and automate repairs across your entire fleet in seconds with just a few lines of code.

Shoreline Agents are efficient and non-intrusive processes running in the background of all your monitored hosts. Agents act as the secure link between Shoreline and your environment's Resources, providing real-time monitoring and metric collection across your fleet. Agents can execute actions on your behalf -- everything from simple Linux commands to full remediation playbooks -- running simultaneously across all the targeted Resources.

Since Agents are distributed throughout your fleet and monitor your Resources in real time, when an issue occurs Shoreline automatically alerts your team before your operators notice something is wrong. Plus, when you're ready for it, Shoreline can automatically resolve these issues using Alarms, Actions, Bots, and other Shoreline tools that you configure. These objects work in tandem to monitor your fleet and dispatch the appropriate response if something goes wrong -- you can even receive notifications via the fully-customizable Slack integration.

Shoreline Notebooks let you convert your static runbooks into interactive, annotated, sharable web-based documents. Through a combination of Markdown-based notes and Shoreline's expressive Op language, you have one-click access to real-time, per-second debug data and powerful, fleetwide repair commands.

### What are Shoreline Op Packs?
Shoreline Op Packs are open-source collections of Terraform configurations and supporting scripts that use the Shoreline Terraform Provider and the Shoreline Platform to create turnkey incident automations for common operational issues. Each Op Pack comes with smart defaults and works out of the box with minimal setup, while also providing you and your team with the flexibility to customize, automate, codify, and commit your own Op Pack configurations.

# Airflow DAG Execution Failure
---

Apache Airflow is an open-source platform used to programmatically schedule, monitor, and manage workflows. A DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) is a collection of tasks with dependencies that can be automated with Airflow. An execution failure of a DAG means that one or more tasks within the workflow failed to execute successfully. This can be caused by various factors such as invalid input data, network issues, software bugs, or resource constraints. The failure of a DAG execution can impact the timely delivery of critical business processes and can cause disruption to the overall workflow management system.

### Parameters
```shell
export DAG_ID="PLACEHOLDER"

export TASK_ID="PLACEHOLDER"

export EXECUTION_DATE="PLACEHOLDER"

export DAG_FILE_PATH="PLACEHOLDER"

export PATH_TO_DEPENDENCIES_FILE="PLACEHOLDER"

export PATH_TO_VIRTUALENV="PLACEHOLDER"

export NAME_OF_THE_DAG="PLACEHOLDER"
```

## Debug

### 1. Check the Airflow webserver status:
```shell
systemctl status airflow-webserver.service
```

### 2. Check the Airflow scheduler status:
```shell
systemctl status airflow-scheduler.service
```

### 3. Check the DAGs folder for any syntax errors:
```shell
airflow dags list

airflow dags show ${DAG_ID}
```

### 4. Check the logs of the failed DAG run:
```shell
airflow logs ${DAG_ID} ${TASK_ID} ${EXECUTION_DATE}
```

### 5. Check the Airflow metadata database for any issues:
```shell
airflow db check
```

### 6. Check the Airflow connections for any issues:
```shell
airflow connections --list
```

### 7. Check the Airflow variables for any issues:
```shell
airflow variables --list
```

### 8. Check the system logs for any relevant errors or warnings:
```shell
journalctl -u airflow-webserver.service

journalctl -u airflow-scheduler.service
```

### Configuration errors in the Apache Airflow DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) file.
```shell
bash

#!/bin/bash



# Check if Airflow is installed

if ! command -v airflow &> /dev/null

then

    echo "Airflow is not installed. Please install Airflow and try again."

    exit 1

fi



# Check if DAG file exists

if [ ! -f "${DAG_FILE_PATH}" ]

then

    echo "DAG file not found. Please provide the correct path to the DAG file."

    exit 1

fi



# Check DAG file for syntax errors

if ! airflow list_dags | grep -q "${DAG_ID}"

then

    echo "DAG not found. Please provide the correct DAG ID."

    exit 1

fi



# Check DAG file for configuration errors

if ! airflow test "${DAG_ID}" "${TASK_ID}" "${EXECUTION_DATE}"

then

    echo "There are configuration errors in the DAG file. Please check the logs for more details."

    exit 1

fi



echo "DAG file is configured correctly."


```

## Repair

### Ensure that all dependencies for the DAG are installed and updated. This includes any packages, libraries, or plugins used in the DAG.
```shell
bash

#!/bin/bash



# define variables

DAG_NAME=${NAME_OF_THE_DAG}

DEPENDENCIES=${PATH_TO_DEPENDENCIES_FILE}



# activate virtual environment if applicable

source ${PATH_TO_VIRTUALENV}/bin/activate



# install dependencies

pip install -r $DEPENDENCIES



# update dependencies

pip install --upgrade -r $DEPENDENCIES



# restart Airflow scheduler and webserver

systemctl restart airflow-scheduler

systemctl restart airflow-webserver



# run the DAG

airflow dags trigger $DAG_NAME


```
